    description: `The tool uses solar intensity data and satellite imagery data to calculate the amount of solar energy hitting your property’s roof. It accounts for several factors about your roof, including area, orientation, and pitch, among other things, to determine solar energy generation potential. It also takes into account shading from trees, nearby structures, and cloud cover. The tool allows you to customize the number of solar panels placed on your home and adjust their size/capacity. To make solar electricity generation estimates, the tool uses current data on solar module capacities, production efficiencies, and degradation rates. The tool allows you to change the amount of annual electricity your home uses to understand how much solar you need to cover 100% of your energy needs. To estimate cost savings, return-on-investment, and payback periods, the tool uses location-specific data on utility rates and a range of all-in solar home system installation costs for your area. The data sets the tool uses come from the Google Maps platform and other sources.`,
